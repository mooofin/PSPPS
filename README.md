Step 0: Research. Spend weeks reading the PPSSPP source code, the PSPVitawiki, and any available MIPS architecture manuals.

tep 1: The CPU. Start by building the MIPS instruction decoder. Create a simple program that can load a snippet of MIPS machine code into a byte array and execute a few simple instructions (like ADD, SUB, ADDI). At this 
stage, you just print the state of the registers to the console.

Step 2: Memory. Implement a basic memory bus that the CPU can read from and write to.

Step 3: Kernel Stubs. Begin implementing the kernel. Start with the most basic functions for threading and logging. When the emulated program calls a kernel function you haven't implemented yet, have it print a message like Unimplemented syscall: sceKernelSleepThread.

Step 4: Loading an Executable. Implement the logic to load an EBOOT.BIN file (a PSP executable) from an ISO into the emulated memory.

Step 5: First Graphics. Set up a window using a library like winit. Implement the most basic GPU commands to clear the screen to a specific color. Getting the first "hello world" homebrew program to display a colored screen is a massive milestone.

Step 6: Iterate for Years. From here, you would spend years slowly implementing more and more instructions, kernel functions, and GPU commands, fixing thousands of bugs along the way.
